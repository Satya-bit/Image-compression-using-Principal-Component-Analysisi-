# Image-compression-using-Principal-Component-Analysis-
The project asks the user to upload the image to be compressed. The image is compressed with the help of Principal Component Analysis. 

**=>Introduction**

*Image compression is done to reduce the size of the original image file without degrading the quality of image.


*Image compression will be done using Principal Component Analysis. 


*PCA finds patterns in the data and compresses the data (i.e. dimensionality reduction) with preserving most of the information.


*The concepts of Linear Algebra which are used in PCA are Mean, Standard deviation, Covariance, transpose, Eigenvalue and Eigenvectors for matrix.
